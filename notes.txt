v18 used resnet34 backbone, lr 1e-3, seed 23498, test frac 0.2, hinge loss, all channels, div2000
v20 used resnet34 backbone, lr 1e-3, seed 534653, test frac 0.2, bce loss, all channels, div2000
v23 used efficientnet-b0 backbone, lr 1e-3, seed 534653, test frac 0.1, dice loss, 3 visible channels, LogTransform
v24 same as 23 but filtered dataset
v39 same as 24 but more filtered dataset, lr 2e-4, seed 45544, all channels, dicebce loss
v40 train v39 from best to do SWA
v44 same as v39 but focal loss and SWA

Note the efficientnet looked better at initiation - less network artefacts

## Didn't work
- cutting down channels
- changing threshold away from 0.5
- focal loss
- bce loss

## did work
- SWA gave small boost on score on board
